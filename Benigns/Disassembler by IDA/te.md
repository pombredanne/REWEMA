## Commercial Antivirus Limitation
Technically, the modus operandi for the identification of malicious files and servers refers to consult in named blacklist databases. The VirusTotal platform issues the diagnoses regarding malignant characteristics related to files and web servers.

When it comes to suspicious files, VirusTotal issues the diagnostics provided by the world's leading commercial antivirus products. Regarding suspicious web servers, VirusTotal uses the database responsible for sensing virtual addresses with malicious practices.

VirusTotal has Application Programming Interface (APIs) that allow programmers to query the platform in an automated way and without the use of the graphical web interface. The proposed paper employs two of the APIs made available by VirusTotal. The first one is responsible for sending the investigated files to the platform server. The second API, in turn, makes commercial antivirus diagnostics available for files submitted to the platform by the first API.
