 # About .header files 
  The header file type is a file type created by the Pexplorer tool that was used to perform the disassembler of the executables contained in the REWEMA database. Because the headers files exceed the maximum file size for upload available by Github. This way the headers are accessible in this link: [malicious download headers](https://mega.nz/#F!9TgkmQxY!jAI1-NdMfd-FBr4Fn7QYZg).
 
## Disassembler tool Pexplorer
#### What is Pexplorer all about?
  PE Explorer gives you the power to look inside these PE binary files, perform static analysis, reveal a lot of information about the function of the executable, and collect as much information about the executable file as possible, without executing it.

PE Explorer leaves you with only minimal work to do in order to get an analysis of a piece of software. Once you have selected the file you wish to examine, PE Explorer will analyze the file and display a summary of the PE header information, and all of the resources contained in the PE file. From here, the tool allows you to explore the specific elements within an executable file.

Besides being an effective Resource Editor, PE Explorer also provides several tools that elevate it to Power Coder status: an API Function Syntax Lookup, Dependency Scanner, Section Editor, UPX Unpacker, and a powerful yet easy-to-use Disassembler. With PE Explorer you can view and inspect unknown binaries, examine and edit the properties of EXE and DLL files, and correct and repair the internal structures of any PE (portable executable) files with the click of a button. PE Explorer is intended to be used in various scenarios such as software development, forensics practice, reverse engineering, extensive binary security analysis and binary auditing processes.
